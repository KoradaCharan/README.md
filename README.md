## 📚 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Sentiment Analysis on Political Speeches**
   - Developed a sentiment analysis model to analyze political speeches using NLP techniques. Implemented Word2Vec word embedding technique to convert textual data into numerical vectors. Built a deep learning model using LSTM neural network architecture for sentiment analysis.
   - Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gensim, Scikit-learn.
   - GitHub Repository: https://github.com/KoradaCharan/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Political-Speeches

2. **Phishing URL detection**
   - Developed a phishing URL detection project using machine learning techniques to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate. Implemented Logistic Regression model after cleaning and processing a large dataset of URLs. Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the performance of the model. The model predicts the phishing URL with an accuracy of 93%.
   - Technologies Used: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Pandas, Numpy, Flask
   - GitHub Repository: https://github.com/KoradaCharan/Phishing_URL_detection

3. **Speech Emotion Recognition**
   - The main objective of this project is to recognize the emotion from the speech samples. CREMA-D dataset is used in which the Speech Samples are converted into spectrograms. A Dense Convolution Neural Network is used to accomplish the task.
   - Technologies Used: Deep Learning
